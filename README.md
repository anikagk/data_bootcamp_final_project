# data_bootcamp_final_project
### Final project for NYU Stern Undergraduate course Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. 

This project was completed by Anika Kumbhakar in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have: 

Clearly agknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that: 

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. 
I agknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course. 

### Project Description 
The results of this project show how smoking rates and average number of cigarettes smoked have changed in different age groups, and whether there is any relationship between that change and the average price of a pack of cigarettes. 

The project and resulting graphics use data from New York City's Community Health Survey (CHS), which is taken annually by the City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2002. They also use cigarette price data from the CDC Study "The Tax Burden on Tobacco,1970-2017"(Orzechowski and Walker).
