# data_bootcamp_final_project
### Final project for NYU Stern Undergraduate course Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. 

This project was completed by Anika Kumbhakar in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have: 

Clearly agknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that: 

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. 
I agknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course. 

### Project Description 
I am exploring changes in rates of cigarette and e-cigarette smoking across different age groups and over time in NYC. The project also looks at how these rates have changed based on changes in cigarette prices/taxes in NYC. It uses data from NYC DOH Community Health Survey.
